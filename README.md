Hello, welcome to the software engineering CBUK programming challenge!


There's no time limit for completing this task. We would expect it to
take no more than a few hours, but we understand that everyone works at their own pace,
so there's no strict deadline. We don't want to be unreasonable and want
to be respectful of your time - so you are not expected to stay up all
night coding away! As with a real project, you may want to take breaks and
your git commits will reflect this. Don't worry, you won't be marked
down for taking breaks.

As you work on your solution, you should make commits to the repository
along the way, just as you would on a real project. This is so we can
see the progression and identify how you came to the solutions you did.

This folder already contains an empty git repository. Your submission will be assessed
independently of the covering letter / CV you have already sent.

Have fun, and feel free to ask questions if anything is unclear.

## Description ##

In the `student_records.json` file is some json output from a hypothetical school 
managment information API. The scenario is that we have performed a request for
students and need to display these records in a UI.



## Your task ##

Your task is to write a build a simple user interface that consumes the data model and solve the following use cases:

* As a school staff user, I need to search for a student record, so i can check their details that include contact and demographic information
* As a school staff user, I need to be able to filter students by their year group, so I can review similar students



As an extension that will require further work with the input data model:
* As a school staff user, I need to be able to review linked contacts for a student, so I can contact parents in an emergency
* As a school staff user, I need to be able to rate students with "stars" 

Provide a simple interface powered by the supplied data that provides the UI components 
that facilitate the above use cases. Be creative! The key things here are displaying data from a source, filtering, accessing and expanding the 
record detail in some way, relating data to linked records and storing/persisting data against a record.



## What we're looking for ##

If you run out of time that's fine, but we urge you to
concentrate your time on the stories above and don't get caught up handling
edge-cases and performance optimisations.

You can assume that program will only ever need to handle the json input
provided and you don't need to implement error handling.

If possible please use TypeScript to complete the task, but vanilla Javascript is 
fine if more comfortable. Please feel free to use a CSS framework to expedite 
development if you wish.
